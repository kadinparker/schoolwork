**** How you can get poisoned

<2016-09-12 Mon>  

 1) Absorption

    Absorption is a process in which something enters your body through the skin. It is a method for toxic substances to enter your body if you aren't careful. Some factors influencing absorption are; Concentration, Duration of contact, and physical condition of the skin. \footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption\_(skin)} 
 2) Inhalation

    Inhalation is when air enters the lungs. Accidental inhalation can occur around dangerous fumes, causing the lungs to partially or fully stop working. \footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation}
 3) Ingestion

    Ingestion is the consumption of a substance by an organism. Dangerous substances or pathogens can be accidentally Ingested, causing damage or death. \footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingestion}
 4) Slip Hazards
    
    Slip Hazards are things that you can slip and fall on, possibly injuring yourself or others. Slip hazards might include; Puddles of liquid, slippery floor, etc.

*** Inside a Single-Lens Reflex Camera 
<2016-09-07 Wed>
:list:
- Basic Features
  * A light-tight box to hold the camera parts and film or a recording chip
  * A viewing system that lets you aim the camera accurately
  * A lens to form an image and a mechanism to focus it sharply
  * A shutter and lens aperture to control the amount of light that reaches the recording surface
  * A means to hold and advance the film or to hold a digital chip and save it's captured information
- Body
  * The light-tight box that contains the camera's mechanisms and protect the film or chip from light until you are ready to make a photograph
- Lens
  * Focuses an image in the viewfinder and on the recording surface: film or sensor
- Lens elements
  * The optical glass lens components that produce the image
- Focusing rings
  * Turning the ring focuses the image by adjusting the distance of the lens from the recording surface. Some cameras focus automatically.
- Diaphragm
  * A circle of overlapping leaves inside the lens that adjusts the size of the aperture. It upens up to increase or closes down to decrease the amount of light reaching the recording surface.
- Aperture ring / button
  * Setting the ring of button determines the size of the diaphragm during exposure
- Mirror
  * During viewing, the mirror reflects light from the lens upward onto the viewing screen. During an exposure, the mirror swings out of the way so light can pass straight to the recording surface.
- Viewing screen
  * A ground-glass (or similar) surface on which the focused image appears
- Pentaprism
  * A five-sided optical device that reflects the image from the viewing screen into the viewfinder
- Metering Cell
  * Measures the brightness of the scene being photographed
- Viewfinder eyepiece
  * A window through which the image from the pentaprism is visible
- Shutter
  * Keeps light from the recording surface until you are ready to take a picture. Pressing the shutter release opens and closes the shutter to let a measured amount of light reach the film or chip
- Film
  * A light-sensitive material that records the image. The ISO, or film speed (the rating of a particular film's sensitivity), is set into the camera by turning a dial or, on some cameras, is set automatically when you load the film. Digital cameras advance film automatically, those and digital cameras have no lever.
- Film advance
  * A lever that advances the film to the next unexposed segment. Most new film cameras advance film automatically; those and digital cameras have no lever.
- Shutter-speed dial or button
  * Selects the shutter speed, the length of time the shutter remains open. On some models, it also sets the mode of automatic exposure operation.
- Shutter release
  * A button that activates the exposure sequence in which the aperature adjusts, the mirror rises, the shutter opens, and the light strikes the recording surface
- Hot shoe
  * A bracket that attaches a flash unit to the camera and provides an electrical linking that synchronizes camera and flash
- Rewind mechanism
  * On manual cameras, a crank you turn to rewind film into its cassette after a roll of film has been exposed. Most new film cameras have a motor the rewind the film automatically
- Film cassette
  - The light-tight container in which 35mm film is packaged. Digital cameras use a memory card to store images.

*** History of Photography
<2016-09-15 Thu>

1. Exposure time for the first photograph was 8 hours
2. In 1835, Daguerre discovered that a polished silver sheet could be made light-sensitive if exposed to iodine vapor.
3. Earliest photographs were printed on metal plates called ``Daguerrotypes'' after the inventor.
4. Joseph Niepce, a Frenchman, created the world's first photograph by spreading a light-sensitive varnish on a polished metal plate and exposing it in a modified camera obscura
5. An American, George Eastman, introduced a 100-shot camera in 1888 along with the trademark, Kodak.
6. The first Camera Obscura was a darkened room with a convex lens inserted in one wall.
7. Exposure times needed to be Shortened to make portraiture more practical.
8. Photographers using the wet collodion process had to take their darkrooms along when they took pictures because the plates had to be exposed and developed while still wet - T
9. Photography took 100 years to reach its present state, and no one person can be credited with its invention - F, took several hundred years
10. The Latin meaning of Photography is ``Writing (graphy) with light (photo)'' - T

Easy way to represent very large and very small numbers
\[N \cdot 10^n\]
N = Coefficient - Number with only one digit to the left of the decimal place. (1-9)

n = Exponent - How to move the decimal in the coefficient to expand the number. Positive for big numbers, negative for small numbers.

1) Move decimal place between the first 2 digits
2) Write the coefficient
3) Count the decimal moves
4) Write the exponent of 10

eg. 15000000K (Standard) --> (Scientific Notation) 1.5x10^7

**** Numbers in Scientific Notation
1) Express each of the following numbers in scientific notation
   - 230 = 2.3x10^2
   - 5601 = 5.601x10^3
   - 14100000 = 1.41x10^7
   - 56000000 = 5.6x10^7
   - 0.2 = 2x10^{-1}
   - 0.45013 = 4.5013x10^{-1}
   - 0.089 = 8.9x10^{-2}
   - 0.00026 = 2.6x10^{-4}
   - 0.000000698 = 6.98x10^{-7}
2) Express each of the following measurements in scientific notation
   - 2997924588 = 2.997924588x10^8
   - 86400 = 8.64x10^4
   - 6378 = 6.378x10^3
   - 0.00142 = 1.42x10^{-3}
   - 0.000000000098 = 9.8x10^{-11}

*** Significant Figures
<2016-09-09 Fri>
_Rules for Significant Figures_

1. All nonzero figures are significant
2. When a zero falls between nonzero digits, that zero is significant
3. When a zero falls after the decimal point and after a significant figure, that zero is significant
4. When a zero is used merely to indicate the position of a decimal, that zero is not significant
5. All counting numbers and exact numbers are treated as if they have an infinite number of significant figures
*** Rounding Numbers to the Correct Number of Significant Digits
<2016-09-12 Mon>
**** Multiplying and Dividing 
To determine the number of significant digits in your final _answer_ when multiplying or dividing, first do the calculation. Then _round_ the answer to the same number of significant digits that is in the number from the question with the _least significant digits_.

eg. $116 / 2.2 = 52.72727273 = 5.3\times10^1$

eg. $25.75 \cdot 2.54 = 65.405 = 6.54\times10^1$ 

**** Adding and Subtracting
When adding or subtracting, first do the calculation. Then round the answer to the same number of decimal places as the number with the fewest decimal places in the question. 

eg. $4.89 + 1.9 + 3.506 = 10.296 = 1.03\times10^1$

**** Multi-Step/Operation Calculation
Apply the rules for multiplication and division. Don't round until the final answer or carry more digits throughout multi-step calculations.

eg. $27.65(1.9) + 100 = 153.535 = 1.5/times10^2$

Remember: 
+/- --> Count Decimal Places
x// --> Count Significant Digits

**** Line of best fit / slope 

The slope of the Line of best fit is 3.70381.

**** Questions

1. Should all of your data points fall on the line of best fit? Explain.

  No, not all of my points should fall on the line of best fit because the measurements aren't precise enough, if they were all on the line of best fit the diameter would have to relate to the circumference perfectly, and some of the bubbles weren't perfect circles.

2. If the true answer for the slope is 3.1415926, Calculate your percentage error for your slope using the following formula.

   \[\%\text{error}=\frac{\text{Experimental Value(slope)} - \text{Actual Value(slope)}}{\text{Actual Value(slope)}}\cdot 100\%\]

   \[\%\text{error}=\frac{3.70381 - 3.1415926}{3.1415926}\cdot 100\%\]

   \[\%\text{error}=17.8959\%\]

3. What sources of errors could happen in this lab?

  Definitely the measurements, the string worked, but there was no way the measurements were 100% accurate for every bubble.

4. How could you limit these errors?

  Use a more precise tool to measure the diameter and circumference of the bubbles.

- The study of motion

**** 2 Types of Motion
***** Uniform
- Movement @ a constant speed in a constant direction or @ rest
- eg. travelling @ 100km/h down a straight highway
- Acceleration = 0
***** Non-Uniform
- Movement that involves changes in speed or direction or both.
- Eg. speeding up from a stoplight or turning a corner.
- Acceleration != 0
**** Physical Quantities
- Numerical values including units (mass, density, length, volume, speed, distance, time, temperature, acceleration, voltage, current, resistance, velocity, displacement, energy)
***** Scalar Quantities
- Have magnitude (size) and unit only
- Eg. 15Kg
***** Vector Quantities
- Have magnitude (size), _direction_, and unit.
- Eg. 120Km/h [NW]
***** Distance
- Total length of the path travelled - symbol: d
d = 4 Km
***** Displacement
- The straight line distance from the start to the end.
- symbol: \(\Delta\)

\(\Delta\) --> "Change In"

\[\vec{\Delta d} = \vec{d_2} - \vec{d_1}\]

\[\vec{\Delta d_R} = \vec{\Delta d_1} + \vec {\Delta d_2} + \vec{\Delta d_3}\] etc.

\(\vec{\Delta d_R}\) = total, overall, resultant, net, sum
***** Position
- The distance and direction from a particular reference point
- Symbol: \(\vec{d}\)
***** Calculate distance (d) and displacement (\(\vec{\Delta d})\)
1. Home --> Library --> Home

  \[d = 1200 + 1200 = 2400m\]
  \[\vec{\Delta d_R} = 1200m[E] + 1200m[W]
  = 1200m[E] + (-1200m)[E]
  = 0m\]

2. School --> Home --> Library

  \[d = 500 + 1200 = 1700m\]

  \[\vec{\Delta d_R} = 500m[W] + 1200m[E]
  = -500m[E] + 1200m[E]
  = 700m[E]\]
***** Vector Quantities
- Can be drawn or represented using arrows
- They should have relative lengths and directions

*** Comparing Graphs of Linear Motion
<2016-10-03 Mon>

Graphical analysis is one of the most powerful analytical tools available to physicists. In studying the motion of objects, analyzing position-time, velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs can help us gain insight into real-life events such as the motion of the cheetah.

1. Car A accelerates from (0 m/s) to 27.8 m/s in 16.0 s. Car B takes 8.0s in the same test. Which car has the greater average acceleration?

2. Kirsten rides her bike up a ramp - at the bottom of the ramp, she is riding at 5.6 m/s. When she reaches to top, she is travelling at 1.8 m/s. If it takes her 28s to ride up the ramp, what is her acceleration?

3. Brad starts his bike down the ramp at 2.8 m/s and then accelerates at 0.25 m/\(s^2\) for 18 s. What is his speed at the end of this time?

4. Kirsten is travelling at 6.5 m/s when she applies her brakes to avoid a patch of loose gravel. She accelerates at a rate of -2.6 m/\(s^2\). How much time does it take her to stop?

5. Brad coasts down a long hill on his bike. He accelerates at 0.12 m/\(s^2\) for 85 s and is travelling at 12.5 m/s at the bottom of the hill. What was his initial speed?

 4. Silicon exists as three isotopes (Table 1). Determine the atomic mass of silicon.

 \[28 \cdot 0.9223 + 29 \cdot 0.0467 + 30 \cdot 0.0310 = 28.1087\]

 5. Imagine an element, X, that has two naturally occurring isotopes. If you know the mass and the percentage abundance of one of the isotopes, how would you determine the percent abundance of the other isotope? Describe your problem-solving process.

 6. The atomic mass of carbon is 12.0107 u. It exists naturally as three isotopes: C-12, C-13 and C-14. Based on your understanding of isotopes and atomic mass, determine which isotope would have the greatest abundance. Explain your choice.

 7. Naturally occurring chlorine consists primarily of two isotopes: Cl-35 and Cl-37. Determine the number of protons, electrons and neutrons forr an atom of each isotope.

elements and their location on the periodic table
****** Background Information
******* Hydrochloric Acid
``Hydrochloric acid is a colourless, highly pungent solution of hydrogen chloride (HCl) in water. It is a corrosive, strong mineral acid with many industrial uses. Hydrochloric acid is found naturally in gastric acid. When it reacts with an organic base it forms a hydrochloride salt.''\cite{wikica}
******* Zinc
``Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It is the first element in group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (\+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).'' \cite{wikizn}
******* Iron 
``Iron is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. It is a metal in the first transition series. It is by mass the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production by fusion in high-mass stars, where it is the last element to be produced with release of energy before the violent collapse of a supernova, which scatters this precursor radionuclide of stable iron into space.'' \cite{wikife}
******* Magnesium
Magnesium is a chemical element with symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column (Group 2, or alkaline earth metals) of the periodic table: all Group 2 elements have the same electron configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure.
Magnesium is the ninth most abundant element in the universe. It is produced in large, aging stars from the sequential addition of three helium nuclei to a carbon nucleus. When such stars explode as supernovas, much of the magnesium is expelled into the interstellar medium where it may recycle into new star systems. Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the fourth most common element in the Earth (after iron, oxygen and silicon), making up 13% of the planet's mass and a large fraction of the planet's mantle. It is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater, after sodium and chlorine. \cite{wikimg}
******* Aluminum 
Aluminium or aluminum (in North American English) is a chemical element in the boron group with symbol Al and atomic number 13. It is a silvery-white, soft, nonmagnetic, ductile metal. Aluminium is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust (after oxygen and silicon) and its most abundant metal. Aluminium makes up about 8% of the crust by mass, though it is less common in the mantle below. Aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different minerals. The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite.\cite{wikial}

The Eagle

1

It was one of those clear,sharp.mustless days
        That summer and man delight in.
Never had Heaven seemed quite so high,
Never had earth seemed quite so green,
Never had the world seemed quite so clean
Or sky so nigh.
        And I heard the Deity’s voice in

  The sun’s warm rays,
        And the white cloud’s intricate maze,
And the blue sky’s beautiful sheen.

         2

I looked to the heavens and saw him there,—
        A black speck downward drifting,
Nearer and nearer he steadily sailed,
Nearer and nearer he slid through space,
In an unending aerial race,
       This sailor who hailed
       From the Clime of the Clouds.—Ever shifting,

  On billows of air
        And the blue sky seemed never so fair,
And the rest of the world kept pace.

         3

On the white of his head the sun flashed bright;
        And he battled the wind with wide pinions,
Clearer and clearer the gale whistled loud,
Clearer and clearer he came into view,—
Bigger and blacker against the blue.
        Then a dragon of cloud
        Gathering all its minions
            Rushed to the fight,
        And swallowed him up in a bite;
And the sky lay empty clear through.

         4

Long I watched.   And at last afar
        Caught sight of a speck in the vastness;
Ever smaller,ever decreasing,
Ever drifting,drifting awayInto the endless realms of day;
        Finally ceasing.
        So into Heaven’s vast fastness
           Vanished that bar
Of black,as a fluttering star
Goes out while still on its way.

         5

So I lost him.   But I shall always see
            In my mind
The warm,yellow sun,and the ether free;
The vista’s sky,and the white cloud trailing,
        Trailing behind,—
And below the young earth’s summer-green arbors,
And on high the eagle,—sailing,sailing
        Into far skies and unknown harbors

***** Devices
I used indentation in my poem to structure the flow of the poem, make some parts faster than others, and to highlight the more important details of the poem.\\
I used imagery to make the image more clear in the readers mind and to lighten the overall mood of the beginning of the poem, before delivering the actual message of the poem.\\
I made the poem a metaphor for finding the good things in life, even if it's not going your way. \\

1. What rules dictate the behaviour of young men and women in relationships today?
No cheating, 
2. Name a situation in which the "rules" have clearly been violated. That is, what are things "nice girls" just don't do? What are things "nice boys" just don't do?
When a "nice girl" or a "nice guy" cheats on their significant other.
3. Why do these rules exist? Do you think they just apply locally or even just in your school? What are the possible consequences of breaking these rules?
These rules exist because 
4. Have you ever encountered a situation where one person in a relationship is ignoring the rules and treating the other person poorly? If so, what did you do? If not, what would do you if you were to experience this?
I have never encountered this situation, though hypothetically if I was the one involved in the relationship I would probably break it off and stop seeing the other person.

- Heroic Couplet
A heroic couplet is a traditional form of English poetry, commonly used in epic and narrative poetry, and consisting of a rhyming pair of lines in iambic pentameter. 
- Iambic Pentameter
Iambic pentameter is a commonly used type of metrical line in traditional English poetry and verse drama. The term describes the rhythm that the words establish in that line, which is measured in small groups of syllables called "feet". The word "iambic" refers to the type of foot that is used, known as the iamb, which in English is an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. The word "pentameter" indicates that a line has five of these "feet".
- Rhyming Couplet
Rhyming couplets are one of the simplest rhyme schemes in poetry. Because the rhyme comes so quickly, it tends to call attention to itself. Good rhyming couplets tend to "explode" as both the rhyme and the idea come to a quick close in two lines.
- Soliloquy
A soliloquy is a device often used in drama when a character speaks to himself or herself, relating thoughts and feelings, thereby also sharing them with the audience, giving off the illusion of being a series of unspoken reflections. If other characters are present, they keep silent and/or are disregarded by the speaker.
- Asides
An aside is a dramatic device in which a character speaks to the audience. By convention the audience is to realize that the character's speech is unheard by the other characters on stage. It may be addressed to the audience expressly (in character or out) or represent an unspoken thought.
- Concealment
Hiding (also called abscondence or concealment) is obscuring something from view or rendering it inconspicuous.
- Tragic Flaw
Tragic flaw is a literary device that can be defined as a trait in a character leading to his downfall and the character is often the hero of the literary piece. This trait could be the lack of self-knowledge, lack of judgment and often it is hubris (pride).
- Hamartia
The term hamartia means "to miss the mark" or "to err". It is most often associated with Greek tragedy, although it is also used in Christian theology. Hamartia as it pertains to dramatic literature was first used by Aristotle in his Poetics. In tragedy, hamartia is commonly understood to refer to the protagonist’s error or flaw that leads to a chain of plot actions culminating in a reversal from their good fortune to bad. 
- Pathos
Pathos represents an appeal to the emotions of the audience, and elicits feelings that already reside in them. Pathos is a communication technique used most often in rhetoric (where it is considered one of the three modes of persuasion, alongside ethos and logos), and in literature, film and other narrative art.
- Catharsis
Catharsis is the purification and purgation of emotions—especially pity and fear—through art or any extreme change in emotion that results in renewal and restoration. It is a metaphor originally used by Aristotle in the Poetics, comparing the effects of tragedy on the mind of a spectator to the effect of a cathartic on the body. 
- Antithesis
Antithesis is used in writing or speech either as a proposition that contrasts with or reverses some previously mentioned proposition, or when two opposites are introduced together for contrasting effect. Antithesis can be defined as "a figure of speech involving a seeming contradiction of ideas, words, clauses, or sentences within a balanced grammatical structure. Parallelism of expression serves to emphasize opposition of ideas". 
- Irony (situational, verbal)
Situational irony is most broadly defined as a situation where the outcome is incongruous with what was expected, but it is also more generally understood as a situation that includes contradictions or sharp contrasts.
- Tragic Irony
A disparity of awareness between actor and observer: when words and actions possess significance that the listener or audience understands, but the speaker or character does not; for example when a character says to another "I'll see you tomorrow!" when the audience (but not the character) knows that the character will die before morning. It is most often used when the author causes a character to speak or act erroneously, out of ignorance of some portion of the truth of which the audience is aware. In tragic irony, the audience knows the character is making a mistake, even as the character is making it. 
- Fate or Destiny
Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual.
- Symbol
A symbol is a sign that represents, stands for or suggests another idea, visual image, belief, action or material entity. Symbols take the form of words, sounds, gestures, ideas or visual images and are used to convey other ideas and beliefs.
- Foreshadowing
Foreshadowing or guessing ahead is a literary device by which an author hints what is to come. Foreshadowing is a dramatic device in which an important plot-point is mentioned early in the story and will return in a more significant way. It is used to avoid disappointment. It is also sometimes used to arouse the reader.
- Self-determination
Making decisions that affect your own outcome.
- Pun
The pun, also called paronomasia, is a form of word play that suggests two or more meanings, by exploiting multiple meanings of words, or of similar-sounding words, for an intended humorous or rhetorical effect. These ambiguities can arise from the intentional use of homophonic, homographic, metonymic, or figurative language.
- Synecdoche
A synecdoche is a figure of speech in which a term for a part of something refers to the whole of something or vice versa.
- Metonymy
Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or concept is called not by its own name but rather by a metonym, the name of something associated in meaning with that thing or concept.
